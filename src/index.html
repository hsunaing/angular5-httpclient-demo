<p>If you see this file in your browser, that means you probably did one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Used the vanilla Angular "ng serve" command. That command does not work with this project.</li>
  <li>Opened the file directly in your browser. That won't work either.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Read the README.md file in the project root for the correct commands to run this project.</strong></p>
<p>Please do not file GitHub issue requests if you see this message. The answer is in the README.</p>
